mbira
=====

Currently in development at [MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences](http://matrix.msu.edu), mbira is a platform to build, serve, and manage native and web-based mobile heritage experiences. The goal of the project is to create a constellation of open source tools (existing and purpose built) that will lower the technical bar for individuals, projects, and institutions interested in building rich, engaging, and sustainable place-based and mobile heritage experiences.
